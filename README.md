## Facebook_Ads_Analytics

#### Project Description:
In this project, I leveraged Python to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Facebook advertising campaigns using various data manipulation and visualization techniques.

I began by loading the statistics of Facebook advertising campaigns into a Pandas DataFrame in a new notebook. The following visualizations were created to derive valuable insights:

1. Grouped the data by day and plotted two key graphs: Graph illustrating daily advertising costs for the year 2021; Chart showcasing daily Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) for 2021. Applied the rolling method to visualize the moving average of costs and ROMI.
2. Grouped the data by campaign name and generated two graphs: Graph depicting the total advertising costs for each campaign; Total ROMI for each campaign.
3. Utilized a box plot to determine the spread of daily ROMI within each campaign.
4. Constructed a histogram displaying the distribution of ROMI values.
5. Created a heatmap illustrating the correlation between all numerical indicators, identifying indicators with the highest and lowest correlations. Explored the correlation of "total_value" with other metrics.
6. Presented the relationship between "total_spend" and "total_value" through a dot plot with linear regression, utilizing the lmplot function.

#### Skills:
